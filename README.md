A frontend project of the Legendary Printworks London website.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML - CSS - JavaScript

I started with making a general skeleton of each section, and eventually moved into adding in more details as time went on. 

## Optimizations

The main animated hero section broke so I replaced it with regular text. I also started it desktop-first but now I am slowly transitioning it to mobile-first (for the sake of responsiveness)

## Lessons Learned:

I learned more about how most users will be looking at this over their phone and the importance of mobile-first development.
